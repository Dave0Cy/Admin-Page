these files have been updated and new one was added with is dashboard in which she gets option to choose to go to edit page (input.html)
to look at the display page(home page) or newsletter and also both of them were updated.

the admin login I believe I implement a login and logout for the app2
by the way app2 is  where all the routes are and i think it where mongodb needs to be link there as well as some database like admin_users
idk if it work because im low on time to connect it to mongodb and also idk how to connect it again srry 

but I do believe that they are all connected sort of
